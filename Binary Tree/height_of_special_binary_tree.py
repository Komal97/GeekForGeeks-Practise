Given a special Binary Tree whose leaf nodes are connected to form a circular doubly linked list. Find the height of this special Binary Tree.
Example 1:
Input:
        1
      /   \
     2     3
    / \
   4   5
  /
 6
Output: 4
â€‹Explanation: 
In the above binary tree, 6, 5 and 3 are leaf nodes and they form a circular doubly linked list. Here, the left pointer of leaf node will act as a previous pointer of circular doubly linked list and its right pointer will act as next pointer of circular doubly linked list.
