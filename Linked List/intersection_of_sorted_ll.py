https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/intersection-of-two-sorted-linked-lists/1
Given two lists sorted in increasing order, create a new list representing the intersection of the two lists. 
The new list should be made with its own memory â€” the original lists should not be changed.
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= size of linked lists <= 5000
1 <= Data in linked list nodes <= 1000

Example:
Input:
2
5 4
1 2 3 4 6
2 4 6 8
4 2
10 20 40 50
15 40

Output:
2 4 6
40
