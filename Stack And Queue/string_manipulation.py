Tom is a string freak. He has got sequences of  n words to manipulate. If in a sequence, two same words come together then heâ€™ll destroy each other. He wants to know the number of words left in the sequence after this pairwise destruction.
Input:
2
5
ab aa aa bcd ab
4
tom jerry jerry tom

Output:
3
0

Explanation:

Test Case 1: ab aa aa bcd ab
After the first iteration, we'll have: ab bcd ab
We can't further destroy more strings and hence we stop and the result is 3. 

Test Case 2: tom jerry jerry tom
After the first iteration, we'll have: tom tom
After the second iteration: 'empty-array' 
Hence, the result is 0.
