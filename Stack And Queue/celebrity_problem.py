You are in a party of N people, where only one person is known to everyone. Such a person may be present in the party, if yes, 
(s)he doesnâ€™t know anyone in the party. Your task is to find the stranger (celebrity) in party.
You will be given a square matrix M[][] where if an element of row i and column j  is set to 1 it means ith person knows jth person.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).
Input :
2
3
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
2
0 1 1 0
Output :
1
-1

Explanation :
Testcase 1:
For the above test case the matrix will look like
0 1 0 
0 0 0
0 1 0
Here,  the celebrity is the person with index 1 ie id 1
