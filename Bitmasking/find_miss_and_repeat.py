Given an unsorted array of size N of positive integers. One number 'A' from set {1, 2, â€¦ N} is missing and one number 'B' occurs twice in array. Find these two numbers.
Input:
2
2
2 2
3 
1 3 3

Output:
2 1
3 2

Explanation:
Testcase 1: Repeating number is 2 and smallest positive missing number is 1.
Testcase 2: Repeating number is 3 and smallest positive missing number is 2.
